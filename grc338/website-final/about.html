                        Talk Taiyaki was founded by a husband-and-wife duo who share a deep love for food and community. With roots in both Asian and Western culinary traditions, they’ve combined their expertise and passion to create a
                        space that celebrates the best of both worlds. Their vision is to provide not just desserts but also a place where people can connect, share stories, and create lasting memories. Every detail, from the menu to the
                        warm ambiance, reflects their commitment to quality and their belief that food has the power to bring people together.
